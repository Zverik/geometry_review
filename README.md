# Geometry Review Tool

This stand-alone page is for reviewing geometries one by one.
You prepare a JSON file for it with features to review, and specify options to choose for each feature.
The result can be exported to a text file, with which you can resume your review if you stop part-way.
There is no server; all the data is stored on your machine locally.
